# HealthCare-Systems-In-GCP
The goal of this project is to create a real-time serving system that gives healthcare providers information about patient outcomes so they may make informed decisions.Machine learning algorithms will be used to assess patient data and make predictions, which will be shown on a user interface.
The system will be constructed in Python and will make use of a variety of tools and frameworks, such as Pandas for data processing, Scikit-learn for machine learning, Flask for web application development, and Docker for containerization. The system will be hosted on a cloud platform like Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud Platform.

Project Scope

The following elements will be included in the project:

Data Collection: The system's data will be obtained from a variety of sources, including electronic health records, medical imaging data, and patient-generated data through wearables and other sensors.
Data Preprocessing: The collected data will be preprocessed and cleaned before being analyzed. This will entail tasks like eliminating missing values, standardizing data, and translating data into a format that machine learning algorithms can understand.

Machine Learning Model Development: After preprocessing the data, an appropriate machine learning algorithm will be chosen, and a model will be built using Scikit-learn. The model will be trained and validated using the preprocessed data to ensure that it makes correct predictions.

Development of a Real-time Serving System: Once the machine learning model has been constructed, it will be delivered to a real-time serving system utilizing Flask and Docker. The system will have a user interface that displays patient data and forecasts, as well as an API that healthcare providers may use to obtain real-time predictions. System monitoring and maintenance will take place to guarantee that the installed system is working well and generating correct predictions. To guarantee that the forecasts remain accurate and relevant throughout time, the algorithm will be updated on a regular basis as new data becomes available.

Data Gathering
Data for the system will be collected from a wide variety of sources, such as electronic health records, data gathered from medical imaging, as well as data supplied by patients themselves through the use of wearables and other sensors. In order to make the processing and analysis of the information more manageable, it will be gathered in an organized fashion.

Data Preprocessing
Once the data has been collected, it will be preprocessed and sanitized so that it is available for analysis. This will entail tasks like eliminating missing values, standardizing data, and translating data into a format that machine learning algorithms can use. The preprocessed data will be divided into training and testing sets, with the majority of the data being utilized to train the machine learning model.

Model Development for Machine Learning
A suitable machine learning approach for the problem at hand will be chosen, and a model will be built using Scikit-learn. The model will be trained and validated using the preprocessed data to ensure that it makes correct predictions. The trained model will be serialized and saved to disk for later use using the joblib library.

Development of a Real-Time Serving System
Following the development of the machine learning model, it will be deployed to a real-time serving system utilizing Flask and Docker. The system will have a user interface that displays patient data and forecasts, as well as an API that healthcare providers may use to obtain real-time predictions. To facilitate scaling and deployment, the system will be deployed to a cloud platform such as Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud Platform.

System monitoring and upkeep
The deployed system will be monitored to ensure that it is running smoothly and accurately. This will entail keeping an eye on system logs, performance data, and error reports. To guarantee that the forecasts remain accurate and relevant throughout time, the algorithm will be updated on a regular basis as new data becomes available.
To ensure the system's security, appropriate security measures will be implemented. Encrypting sensitive data, installing access restrictions, and maintaining compliance with relevant legislation and standards, such as HIPAA, will be among these.

Project Schedule
At the end of the project, the following deliverables will be provided:

A real-time serving system that delivers information about patient outcomes and allows healthcare providers to make informed decisions.
Project documentation, encompasses system architecture, data processing, machine learning model development, and real-time serving system development.
A user guide describing how to utilize the real-time serving system.
A deployment guide for deploying the real-time serving system on a cloud platform.
A maintenance strategy describing how the system will be monitored and updated over time.

Finally, the goal of this project is to create a real-time serving system that gives healthcare providers insights into patient outcomes, allowing them to make informed decisions. Machine learning algorithms will be used to assess patient data and make predictions, which will be shown on a user interface. Data collection, data preprocessing, machine learning model creation, real-time serving system development, and system monitoring and maintenance will all be part of the project. A real-time serving system, documentation, a user manual, a deployment guide, a maintenance plan, and a project report will be among the project deliverables.
